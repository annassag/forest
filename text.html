<p>In act two of Shakespeare’s 1599 comedy <i>As You Like It</i> the characters, for differing reasons, all seek refuge in the Forest of Arden. Shakespeare is using the forest as a <i>mode</i>, an impermanent refuge, a place of magical transformation outside the constraints of the real world. Desire flows from one character to the other, man becomes woman becomes man, and time is both suspended and subjective at once.

ROSALIND [dressed as Ganymede]:<br>
I pray you, what is ‘t the o’clock?<br><br>
ORLANDO:<br>
You should ask me what time o’day. <br>There’s no clock in the forest.<br><br>
ROSALIND [dressed as Ganymede]:<br>
Then there is no true lover in the forest; <br>else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.<br><br>
ORLANDO:<br> 
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that been as proper?<br><br>
ROSALIND [dressed as Ganymede]:<br>
By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. <br>I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, <br>who Time trots withal, <br>who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withal.<br>

</span></p>

<p>Already several centuries ago, Shakespeare contested the notion of a uniform pace of life and an equal temporal grid and instead showed that time functions in many ways, together with mobility too. Social groups, and in this instance: the characters of <i>As You Like It</i>, have different and conditional relationships to time and space–some people come and go as they wish, others are dependent on other people’s time and presence, others again have the forest as their mainstay. In this choose-your-own-adventure style text message version of Shakespeare’s play, you walk in and out and around in the forest in the shoes of the chosen character, or if you wish: at their level of time. Move around as you like, per Shakespeare's wish, in the Forest of Arden–the Forest of All-Day. Who stands still, who gallops, and who is the last to exit?</p>

<p><span class="underline">JAQUES: All the world’s stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players.<br>
They have their exits and their entrances.
